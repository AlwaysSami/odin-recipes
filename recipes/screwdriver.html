        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These screwdriver jello shots are so fun. Orange peels are filled with fresh orange juice, vodka, and gelatin, then cut into jello shot wedges.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 oranges</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup vodka</li>
            <li>1/4 cup triple sec</li>
            <li>2 (1 ounce) packets gelatin</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut oranges in half and juice them using a reamer. Use a paring knife to loosen the pith from the rind and carefully remove the insides from the orange halves; reserve the hollowed peels.</li>
            <li>Strain orange juice using a fine mesh strainer over a bowl and add a little water if needed to measure 1 1/2 cups total juice.</li>
            <li>Add orange juice to a small saucepan and stir in sugar. Bring mixture to a boil, stirring often, until sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, whisk vodka, triple sec, and gelatin together until gelatin dissolves.</li>
            <li>Pour hot orange juice mixture into the bowl with gelatin mixture and whisk until combined.</li>
            <li>Place orange peel halves onto a plate or small rimmed baking sheet, side by side to ensure they stay upright. Secure oranges with foil or ramekins as needed to hold them upright during filling and transferring to the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Carefully pour orange mixture into each orange peel, making sure to fill each one to the top. Place oranges into the refrigerator and chill until gelatin is firmly set, at least 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Slice oranges into wedges and serve. Keep chilled until ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
